Concession principle in synthesis: every surviving position represented proportionally.","notes":"{\"tasks\":[\"Update quest SKILL.md to use npc context for per-member loading\",\"Add --mode debate to quest argument parsing\",\"Implement Position phase (each member states 2-4 sentence position)\",\"Implement Exchange phase (2-3 rounds, must address others by name)\",\"Implement Synthesis phase (arbiter produces merged recommendation)\",\"Define arbiter agent spec (Neutral Good, no class, synthesis-only)\",\"Add --conviction flag for quest-level shared convictions\",\"Implement debate output format (positions, exchange rounds, synthesis with surviving points table, unresolved tensions, concessions)\",\"Update quest briefing to show depth fields when available\"]}","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"cory.shepherdson@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-10T11:02:04.310659-05:00","created_by":"Cory Shepherdson","updated_at":"2026-02-10T16:06:40.898485-05:00","labels":["npc:phase-5"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"rpg-w05.5","depends_on_id":"rpg-w05","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-10T11:02:04.311383-05:00","created_by":"Cory Shepherdson"},{"issue_id":"rpg-w05.5","depends_on_id":"rpg-w05.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-10T11:02:09.319591-05:00","created_by":"Cory Shepherdson"}]}
